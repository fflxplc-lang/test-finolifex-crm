/* A PAGE ALLOW-LIST THAT TOOK AWAY SOMEBODY'S OWN RECORD.

   Narrowing an account to named pages is a real feature: a Senior
   Executive is given the twenty-eight screens he works and nothing
   else. What nobody meant is what came with it. The picker in Setup
   names pages from the rail, and neither My Profile nor the Dashboard
   is on the rail — so the moment one page was ticked, both of those
   closed, with nothing in Setup able to tick them back. The man could
   not open his own profile to put a phone number in it, and the
   refusal sent him to the Dashboard, which the same rule had shut.

   What this holds to: that the two personal pages are never closed by
   that list, while every other page on it still is; that a person may
   fill in their own details and the firm's record of them actually
   changes, on the server, not just on the screen; that the fields
   which say what an account IS — role, scope, status, sign-in email,
   employee id, reporting line — are text on that page and cannot be
   written from it even by a forged input; and that none of this opens
   anybody else's profile or a single Setup screen. */
